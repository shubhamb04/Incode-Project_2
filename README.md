# Incode-Project_2 MR. COFFEE
- Building a website for a cafe Mr.Coffee.
- As a requirement from the client, it is built using only in HTML & CSS.
- Used javaScript for contact form validation and handling.
- Since client is based in France, so he wanted all the content to be in french to target local audience.
- Followed the best SEO practices for on-page optimization.

## Flexbox & Grid
- I used flexbox and grid to implement complex responsive layouts, this project helped me get better understanding of both.
- It was pretty easy to align the elements with the help of Grid and Flexbox.

## Challenges
- One challenging task for me was to toggle menu without javaScript.
- I never did it before only with CSS, so it was something new i learned.

## Future Implementation
- I am hoping to add some interactive features, planning on making it fully interactive.
- Going to use other styling options to write more clean codes.
