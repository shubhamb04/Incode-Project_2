# Incode-firstProject MR. COFFEE
- Building a website for a cafe Mr.Coffee.
- As a requirement from the client, it is built using only in HTML & CSS.
- Since client is based in France, so he wanted this project to be in french to target local audience.

## Flexbox & Grid
- I implemented flexbox and grid, this project helped me get better understanding of both.

## Challenges
- One challenging task for me was to toggle menu without javaScript.
- I never did it before, so i learned it and implmented.
